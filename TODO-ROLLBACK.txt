MILESTONE 3 (cleanup & bug fix):

 - Bug: Mismatched position starting at tick 1
   |-> Is it the initial state not matching? Or, are we receiving input ticks from a previous match?
   |-> If previous match we could use some kind of random "Match ID" (int) to keep messages unique

BUG THAT MIGHT BE FIXED (watch out for them):

 - Bug: P1 uses Zap, on the next frame P1 & P2 agree on its position, but P3 has a different position
   |-> It moved slightly on the frame that zap is used - shouldn't happen
 - Bug: P1 has tracer, bullet targets P2, but P2 has null for the target
 - Bug: Pickup sometimes appears in one spot, gets picked up (with no effect) and then reappears in a different spot
 - Bug: TheKlin boosted and immediately zapped and then was zooming all over

UNCONFIRMED BUGS:

 - Bug: Elliot having input issues during "Regaining sync..."
