====

 - Convert to official Nakama client
 - Adjust opcodes so that higher values are used (101, 102, 103?)

OLD MILESTONES
--------------

MILESTONE+1:

 - Randomize game starting positions and colors
 - Limit all powerups to 20 seconds?
   * Show current power up next to player name (flash when low)
 - Gameplay ideas to test:
   * Count down to next drop crates (start at 5 seconds?)
   * A "chanrged shot" that causes more damage? To encourage more careful
     firing.
   * More "tanky" feel (acceleration/deceleration, turret rotation limit, etc)
 - Improve game "feedback"
   * Better indication that a tank got hit
 - Polish:
   * Muzzle flash
   * Bullet smoke
   * Explosion particles
   * Tank tracks
   * Movement dust
 - Match score keeping
   * Stats (bullets fired vs hits, total damage caused)
   * "Sets" like 2 out of 3, best out of 5

MILESTONE+2:

 - Bug: Everyone marks "Ready" but the game doesn't start
 - Look into issue where Arturo picks up more health than everybody else
 - Reduce the number of RPC updates sent (only send when something changes)
   |-> This could be done by sending inputs (keys pressed) rather than
       positions and rotations. So, sending global mouse position rather
       than turret rotation (which is constantly changing)
 - Add logging to remote server so we can track down issues with split
   mesh and WebRTC peer reconnection

MILESTONE+3:

 - Add Nakama leaderboard (maybe just wins at first)
 - Add built-in bug reporting (maybe post to a webform on snopekgames.com?)

MILESTONE+4:

 - Get web version working on Mobile
   * On-screen tank controls
   * Show the keyboard when focusing controls:
     o https://www.reddit.com/r/godot/comments/8r6dgf/godot_31dev_html5_export_mobile_devices_and/
 - Add options for controls, enabling mouse capture, etc

MILESTONE+5:

 - Support for multiple maps
 - Add game modes like "capture the flag"
 - Encapsulate the different bullet types into a single unit such that
   you could theoretically mod a new bullet type into the project
 - Implement modding support

MILESTONE+6:

 - Polish! Music, sound effects, etc

BACKLOG:

 - Save and restore sessions so you don't have to login as much
 - Allow users to use "practice mode" while they wait for matchmaking
 - Make the "target" of targeted bullets clear (highlight selected tank)
 - Allow "stacking" powerups? Like, targetted/spread?
 - "Fire" bullet powerup: area of effect where it lands with higher damage
 - "Defense" powerup: take no damage (or reduced damage) for 20 seconds
 - "Zoom" powerup: increased movement speed for 20 seconds
 - "Invisibility" powerup: tank is invisible to other players for 20 seconds
