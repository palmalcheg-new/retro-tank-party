 - Allow up to 4 players to join and get placed
 - Each tank needs a different color
 - Each tank needs it's name displayed
 - Add bullets, health and damage
 - Add a health bar
 - Add explosion (bullet and tank)
 - Add "loop" to have a winner and allow restarting
   |-> Zoom out after death to see the whole battle?
 - Set sane starting rotation for all players
 - Add cover to make play actually interesting
 - Keep players in the player area!
 - Make color coded bullets for each player
 - Add a one-player test mode to make it easier to test gameplay changes
 - Add health power-up
 - Add more power ups
   |-> Spread bullets
   |-> Target bullets

TODO:

 - Reduce the number of RPC updates sent (only send when something changes)
 - Ability to return to connection screen
   |-> Return while waiting for players or after timeout to connect
   |-> Server: Disconnect all clients and return to configure
   |-> Client: Disconnect from server and return to configure
   |-> Maybe this is an [EXIT] button in the top-right corner?
       |-> This can clarify the mouse confinement as well!
 - Some kind of score keeping (maybe wins per player per current session?)
 - Improve the connection UI (make real UI and seperate server/client options)

BACKLOG (the "maybe" things):

 - Encapsulate the different bullet types into a single unit such that
   you could theoretically mod a new bullet type into the project
 - Count down to next drop crates (start at 10 seconds?)
 - Make the "target" of targeted bullets clear (highlight selected tank)
 - A "chanrged shot"? To encourage more careful aiming
 - Limit all powerups to 20 seconds?
   |-> We'd need some indication on the tank of it's status...
 - Allow "stacking" powerups? Like, targetted/spread?
 - "Fire" bullet powerup: area of effect where it lands with higher damage
 - "Defense" powerup: take no damage (or reduced damage) for 20 seconds
 - "Zoom" powerup: increased movement speed for 20 seconds
 - "Invisibility" powerup: tank is invisible to other players for 20 seconds
